# base_ubuntu_setup_cookbook

This cookbook installs the fundamental Linux tools for a new dev box such as OpenSSH and text editor, and sets up a NFS mount if the NFS IP address attribute is configured.

## Development

First run `bundle install` to install all the required RubyGems. Then run `rake` to execute the spec tests.
